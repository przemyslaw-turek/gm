<P style="line-height: 1cm; ">Grandma monitor is a system created to monitor conditions inside of old person's flat.
The system uses diffrent sensors to collect informations about movement, temperature etc. and send it via internet to protector. 
Main controler (Raspberry Pi 3) is connected with big red button, which turn on panic alarm (on protectors mobile device).
Except Raspberry Pi we use also ESP8266 which supports whireless communication and enables putting sensors in the other part of the flat. </P>

<P style="line-height: 1cm; ">Befor you begin instalation you need to decide which sensors you want to use and where to put them.
Here is the list of the sensors that we support:</P>
<LI> MQ-2 Semiconductor Sensor for Combustible Gas  </LI>
<LI> PIR HC-SR501 Motion Sensor </LI>
<LI> DS18B20 Temperature Sensor </LI>
<LI> DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor</LI>
