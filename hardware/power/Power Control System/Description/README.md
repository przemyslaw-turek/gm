<h1>Power Control System</h1>
This chip was created to make our microprocessor powered at all times.
In case of power failure, the system should be powered from Power Bank.
When Power bank  is charging does not give the output voltage.	

You need to do one of two layouts. The first one is easier to implement and the second one does not disturb the operation of the control device.

The third system is designed for advanced electronics. For this layout we have not prepared the program code. It is shown for illustrative purposes

If you use the first chip, you will need to use 3 GPIO to control the power supply(A0,D5 and D6).

In turn, using the first scheme will suffice with two pins(A0 and D5).
