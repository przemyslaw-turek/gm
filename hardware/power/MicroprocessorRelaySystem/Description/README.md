Microprocessor relay system
Through this arrangement we have the ability to control devices powered by alternating current.
In order to realize this layout you have to combine elements according to the schematic.
You can prepare the chip yourself, or use a pcb board design.
Please upload to esp8266 prepared program in Arduino IDE.
If you upload a program and specify good network parameters you should get the following form of serial port monitor:

Open the Arduino serial monitor at a baud rate of 115200. 
After a few seconds your IP address should appear.

Open any browser from a device that is connected to the same router that your ESP is. Then type the IP address and click Enter!



You should see the following image:

Now when you press the buttons in your web server you can control any device connected!!!
